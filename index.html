        <p>This page was created with a special purpose: to honor and gift my girlfriend, my sweetheart, my favorite person in the world — Maria Clara Barros Rodriguez. It's a heartfelt apology for the moments I may have hurt you or made you feel anything less than loved, but also a deep thank you for staying by my side. I’m truly grateful for your presence, your love, and your unwavering support.</p>

      <h2>Who's Yuumi?</h2>
      <p>A magical cat from Bandle City, Yuumi was once the familiar of a yordle enchantress, Norra. When her master mysteriously disappeared, Yuumi became the Keeper of Norra's sentient Book of Thresholds, traveling through portals in its pages to search for her.</p>
      <p>Yearning for affection, Yuumi seeks friendly companions to partner with on her journey, protecting them with luminous shields and fierce resolve. While Book strives to keep her on task, Yuumi is often drawn to worldly comforts, such as naps and fish. In the end, however, she always returns to her quest to find her friend.</p>

        </div>
          <article>
            <h3>Splash Art:</h3>
            <p>Adorable and simple, could be better but honestly, adding too much detail to this specific sort of splash art could make it too visually polluted, it's pleasant how it's effortlessly pretty.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h3>3D Model Preview:</h3>
            <p>Again, gorgeous. Actually no mistakes, no defects, just perfect. Looks just like the splash art and looks even better in game (which is difficult for skins nowadays). Not much to say about it, might be flawless.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h3>Skill Effects:</h3>
            <p>Great skill effects, though the shield is what stands out the most (besides the ultimate), looks absolutely stunning, the blue, the little hearts(that resemble latte art hearts), the bubble-like look, it stands out in a way it makes ugly champs look pretty when they have a cafe cuties yuumi on them. The ult also looks so good, all the bows, the little heart arch and the stun effects on enemies are on point. Not to mention the sfx and voicelines which are also super well done.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h3>Overall</h3>
            <p>Honestly best skin for her yet (off both games), the color palette, the voicelines and especially the animations being super neat and the whole visual of it just gives Yuumi vibes, she suits brown a little too well. The heterochromia, the headband, THE FUR AROUND HER NECK and foremost the book design, actually gorgeous how big it got in this skin and how it's extremely rich in detail. Homeguard's a little simple considering it's a legendary skin, could have better animation, more particles and effects. Also, the default pose of her laying on the book looks better than the actual pose of her fiddling with the teacup.</p>
